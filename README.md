##ML-Based Air Quality and CO₂ Emission Analysis
Project Overview

This project explores time-series forecasting and machine learning models to analyze and predict CO₂ emissions and overall air quality trends.
We started with CO₂ data (from Mauna Loa Observatory and other sources) as a baseline and plan to extend it into a complete air quality profile, including:

Temperature

Humidity

Precipitation

Other greenhouse gases (CH₄, NOₓ, etc.)

Sector-wise emission analysis (transportation, industry, households, etc.)

The ultimate goal is to identify which sectors contribute the most to air pollution and highlight where reduction efforts will have the biggest impact.
