# ML-Based Air Quality Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project extends prior work on **CO₂ forecasting** into a **multivariate air quality profile**.  
Our goal is to analyze not just CO₂, but also humidity, temperature, precipitation, and other gases, 
and identify which **sectors (transport, industry, household, etc.)** contribute most to emissions.

## Current Progress
- Literature review drafted (6 major research papers summarized).
- Baseline ARIMA forecast implemented on existing CO₂ dataset.
- Repo structure prepared for future work (data ingestion, modeling, dashboard).

## Next Steps
- Acquire real-time city-level air quality data (temperature, humidity, other gases).
- Extend models to multivariate forecasting (tree ensembles, LSTM, Transformers).
- Add sector-wise attribution and explainability (SHAP, feature importance).
- Build Streamlit dashboard for visualization and policy insights.
